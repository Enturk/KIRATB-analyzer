# KIRATB-analyzer
Batch processed several million tweets using Python, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, and Twitter API for NLP sentiment analysis, visualized with auto-calculating and -normalizing spreadsheet graphs.

Developed in tight collaboration with Victor Arriaza and Mecheal Greene. This repo should probably be merged with their github accounts, but I'm not sure how to do that...
